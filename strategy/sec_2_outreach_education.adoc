== Outreach and Education

Like any other capability, GeoPackage requires outreach so that members of the geospatial community understand the format and how it can be used as an enabling technology for challenges they are trying to meet. Some ways that we perform outreach include the following:
* http://geopackage.org
* Social media
* Public appearances
* Public articles

### Data
We want people to be able to find relevant data in the GeoPackage format quickly and easily. We are not seeing as much public data published in the GeoPackage format as we would like.

* [x] [data page](http://www.geopackage.org/data.html) - currently very sparse
  * [x] New Zealand
  * [x] Minnesota - currently 423 datasets, but a fairly primitive search interface
  * [x] Australian Bureau of Statistics
  * [x] Energydata.info
  * [ ] NRL
  * [ ] http://geoplatform.gov has not prioritized GeoPackage support
* [x] Social Media - minimal impact so far
* [x] TC Plenary announcement
* [x] [OGC Meeting Topic](https://github.com/ogcscotts/TC-Meeting-topics/issues/41)
* [ ] Others?

### Implementations
The [implementations page](http://www.geopackage.org/implementations.html) provides a curated list of organizations that have indicated GeoPackage support. (This is completely different from the [OGC-maintained list](http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/stats).) There is still more work to be done to indoctrinate GPKG as a solution.
* [ ] [ATAK](https://atakmap.com/)
* [ ] others

### Guidance
Guidance informs potential users of the format, making it easier to use it appropriately and with as little unnecessary effort as possible. This area will continue to evolve. It is difficult to get people to write useful documentation but we will use whatever we can get.

* [x] [getting started guide](http://www.geopackage.org/guidance/getting-started.html) - where new developers should look to understand how GeoPackages are organized. This guide now includes information for the core and all adopted extensions. It is getting positive feedback.
* [x] [Community Extensions](http://www.geopackage.org/extensions.html) - this page contains a curated list of all known community extensions
* [x] [Implementation Guide](http://www.geopackage.org/guidance/implementation_guide.html) - this page catalogs a taxonomy of GeoPackage capabilities and indicates a set of capability levels for each capability, along with samples aligned to each capability level. This is a relatively new idea and it remains to be seen whether we have the right approach or not.
  * [ ] Self-assessment tool? See [Interoperability Suite](#interoperability-suite).
  * [ ] Publicity campaign?
* [ ] **Howto Guide** - how to produce certain samples. __Is it possible to do this in a way that is vendor agnostic?__ Maybe the SWG should not be responsible for publishing this.
  * [ ] SHP -> GPKG
  * [ ] WMS -> GPKG
  * [ ] tile pyramid -> GPKG
  * [ ] others?
* Articles for poorly understood extensions
  * [ ] [Zoom Other Intervals](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_zoom_other_intervals) to allow non-powers of two tile pyramids (TileMill integration?)
  * [ ] [Schema](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_schema)
  * [ ] [Metadata](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_metadata)
* [Guidance](http://www.geopackage.org/guidance.html) page containing articles for frequently asked questions and non-obvious solutions. Maybe we should also curate a list of public articles. We are starting to see more articles published publicly.
  * [x] [Data Modeling](http://www.geopackage.org/guidance/modeling.html)
  * [ ] **Views - we were recently asked about this and we should try to turn something around as quickly as possible**

### Online Standard
We want users to be able to find and use the standard as quickly and easily as possible. People appear to be happy with what we have here.

### Blog Postings
I occasionally post articles on http://geopackage.blogspot.com. These tend to be more process and management-based than technical.
