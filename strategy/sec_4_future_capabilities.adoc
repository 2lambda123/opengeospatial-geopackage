### OWS Context
Image Matters has indicated interest in this. It would allow Context files to be stored in GeoPackages. A context can represent a single common operational picture. This would allow for a separation of GeoPackage data and its presentation.
* [x] Proof of concept
* [x] [Discussion Paper](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/dp/18-037r1/18-037r1.html)
* [ ] **Dependency on updated portrayal standards (style encoding)**
* [x] Community Extension
* [ ] Interoperability Experiment or other test activity
* [ ] Draft Standard

### Tiled Vector Data
Through the [Vector Tiles Pilot](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/vt-pilot-2018), OGC is developing interoperable solutions for tiled vector data. There are five (small) proposed extensions as part of this effort:
1. Vector Tiles
1. Mapbox Vector Tiles
1. GeoJSON Vector Tiles
1. OWS Context (see above)
1. Vector Tiles Attributes (extends Related Tables Extension)

* GeoPackage Vector Tiles Extensions Engineering Report
   * [x] Draft posted to pending
   * [ ] TC adoption
   * [ ] OGC Publication
* Vector Tiles Pilot (focusing on portrayal)
   * [ ] Consensus development
   * [ ] Draft ER posted to pending
   * [ ] TC ER adoption
   * [ ] OGC ER Publication
* Next steps?

### 3D Tiles
Compusult has indicated interest in an extension based on 3D Tiles, which is now an [OGC Community Extension](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=79136). It should be fairly straightforward to implement this in GeoPackage, although SWG members may have differing points of view on implementation details.

* [x] Presentation to GPKG SWG

* [ ] Interoperability Experiment
* [ ] Draft Standard

### Multi-resolution vector data
Compusult has presented this idea, but it is unclear whether there is any need to standardize it. Maybe a community extension and/or article will be sufficient?

### Concepts with no advocate
* styling / symbology (does this now fall under OWS Context?)
* point clouds (this may come for free with 3D tiles)
* non-SQLite implementations
* compression
* synchronization / replication
* 4D / augmented reality
