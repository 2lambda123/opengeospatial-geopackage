GeoPackage Specification
==========

This is a github version of the GeoPackage 0.8 specification released for public comment. 
See http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/requests/105 for more information.

Reading the document
--------------------
The main specification is in the [spec/](spec/) folder. 

Editing and commenting
----------------------
The GeoPackage SWG is accepting public comments and suggested revisions to the specification via GitHub. This is the first time OGC has supported this mechanism for public comment and review. 
It is preferred that suggested changes to the specification are done by modifying the actual document, using pull requests against this repository. 
However, you may also make more general comments by submitting an issue on the repository. Click the "exclamation point within a circle" icon on the right side of the window to go to the issue view.
For more detailed guidance, see [process.md](process.md).

If you are new to GitHub then just hit 'edit' on any of the specification pages.
This will automatically 'fork' the repository in to your own copy. After editing there you can create 
a 'pull request' from your fork to submit the work for review and merging. 
Read ![Forking a Repo help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) or email techdesk@opengeospatial.org if you have questions about this process.

If you are making a more substantial set of changes please create a branch to work on the set. Pull requests
stay with the branches they are made on, so if you make more changes based on feedback that can all get 
pulled in when ready. Note you can create new branches as well as new files completely through the web.

For more on markdown there is a great [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
And note you can hit 'preview' at any time in edit mode to see if you got things right.
