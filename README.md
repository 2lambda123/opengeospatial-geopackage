GeoPackage Tiles Specification
==========

This is a github version of the GeoPackage specification released for public comment.

The main specification is in the [spec/](spec/) folder. 

Help with cleaning the markdown to more closely match the specification is appreciated.

We are working on a process to allow public comments as github pull requests against this repository. 
See [process.md](process.md) for more information.

If you are a github newbie then just hit 'edit' on any of the specification pages.
This will automatically 'fork' the repository in to your own copy. After editing there you can create 
a 'pull request' from your fork to submit the work for review and merging.

If you are making a more substantial set of changes please create a branch to work on the set. Pull requests
stay with the branches they are made on, so if you make more changes based on feedback that can all get 
pulled in when ready. Note you can create new branches as well as new files completely through the web.

For more on markdown there is a great [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
And note you can hit 'preview' at any time in edit mode to see if you got things right.
