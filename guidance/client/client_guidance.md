### GeoPackage Client Guide
The purpose of this guide is present
While the GeoPackage Encoding Standard does not specify client requirements, there are certain expectations that the developers of the standard had when it was developed.
Where possible, the guidelines are presented in a _tiered_ approach using multiple _capability levels_. Capability Level 0 indicates a fair and reasonable use of GeoPackage for closed scenarios but that will not provide interoperability with other use cases or applications and therefore falls short of what can be considered compliant. Capability Level 1 indicates the minimum level of interoperability and compliance and the levels increase from there. Capability Level 3 generally indicates the long-term vision for GeoPackage compliance.

This approach allows developers to develop their software incrementally, achieving useful capabilities at a pace aligned with their own roadmaps and business models.
The approach also gives guidance back to the SWG â€“ some capability levels are not achievable today and these should be given highest priority in future SWG activities.

### Contents
The `gpkg_contents` table lists the contents that are available in a GeoPackage. A client should use this table 

###### Level 0
Load and utilize one or more sets of contents (tiles or features) using hard-coded table names.

###### Level 1
Load and utilize a single set of contents (tiles or features) by picking the first item in `gpkg_contents`.

###### Level 2
Load the contents from `gpkg_contents`, present the user a list of contents to utilize, and allow the user to open one or more of them.

###### Level 3
Load a list of OWS Context files, each representing a specific use case or scenario, and allow the user to select one for use.
> Note: The specification for this capability is still being developed.

### Spatial Reference System (SRS)
The `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table lists the SRSs that are in use in a GeoPackage. 

###### Level 0
GeoPackage contents are utilized without recognition of SRSs.

###### Level 1
GeoPackage software supports the default SRSs of EPSG::4326 (WGS-84), 0 (undefined geographic coordinate reference systems), and -1 (undefined Cartesian coordinate reference systems).

###### Level 2
GeoPackage software supports arbitrary SRSs that are listed in `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys`. The software performs any transformations needed if multiple SRSs are in use at the same time.

###### Level 3
GeoPackage software supports arbitrary SRSs that are encoded in [CRS WKT2](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html), using the [WKT for CRS Extension](../extensions/wkt_for_crs.md).

### Features

#### Geometries

###### Level 0
GeoPackage software supports at least one simple geometry type (point, line, or polygon).

###### Level 1
GeoPackage software supports all "simple features" primitive geometry types (point, line, polygon, multipoint, multiline, and multipolygon).

###### Level 2
GeoPackage software supports geometry collections of arbitrary size and complexity. It also supports 3D and 4D geometries using the Z and M coordinates. GeoPackage writing software also supports the [RTree Spatial Index Extension](../extensions/rtree_spatial_indexes.md) and uses this extension to improve spatial querying performance.

###### Level 3
GeoPackage software supports extended geometry types using the [Nonlinear Geometry Types Extension](../extensions/nonlinear_geometry_types.md).

#### Attributes

###### Level 0
GeoPackage software supports hard-coded attributes.

###### Level 1
GeoPackage software supports arbitrary attributes of any name and [supported data type](http://www.geopackage.org/spec120/#table_column_data_types).

###### Level 2
GeoPackage software supports arbitrary attributes that are defined using the [Schema Extension](../extensions/schema.md).

###### Level 3
GeoPackage software supports many-to-many relationships between features and attributes using the Related Tables Extension.

> NOTE: This capability is still under development.

### Tiles

#### Tile Matrix Sets

###### Level 0
GeoPackage software supports the Google Maps-compatible Tile Matrix Set.

###### Level 1

###### Level 3
GeoPackage software supports tile matrix sets with arbitrary zoom levels using the [Zoom Other Intervals](../extensions/zoom_other_intervals.md) extension. When useful, this extension is used to preserve the quality of the highest zoom level and minimize the bloat of the GeoPackage.

#### Tile Encoding

###### Level 1
GeoPackage software supports PNG and JPG tiles.

###### Level 2
GeoPackage-producing software produces heterogeneous tile sets for imagery overlays, using JPG files (with their superior compression) for central tiles and PNG (with alpha channel transparency) for border tiles so that the user is able to see the underlying layers at the edge of the imagery coverage area.

###### Level 3
GeoPackage software supports the WebP format using the [Tiles Encoding WebP Extension](../extensions/tiles_encoding_webp.md). GeoPackage producers use this format to reduce GeoPackage size when the expected clients are known to support it.
