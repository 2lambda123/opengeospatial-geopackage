== Security Considerations

Security considerations for implementations utilizing GeoPackages are in the domain of the implementing application, deployment platform, operating system and networking environment.
The GeoPackage standard does not place any constraints on application, platform, operating system level or network security.

Since GeoPackage is dependent on SQLite, implementors should monitor for security alerts related to SQLite and respond accordingly.
