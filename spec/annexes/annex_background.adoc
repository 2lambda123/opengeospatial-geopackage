=== Preface

An open standard non-proprietary platform-independent GeoPackage container for distribution and direct use of all kinds
of geospatial data will increase the cross-platform interoperability of geospatial applications and web services.
Standard APIs for access and management of GeoPackage data will provide consistent query and update results across such
applications and services. Increased interoperability and result consistency will enlarge the potential market for such
 applications and services, particularly in resource-constrained mobile computing environments like cell phones and
 tablets. GeoPackages will become the standard containers for “MyGeoData” that are used as a transfer format by users
 and Geospatial Web Services and a storage format on personal and enterprise devices.

This OGC® GeoPackage Encoding Standard defines a GeoPackage as a self-contained, single-file,
cross-platform, serverless, transactional, open source SQLite data container with table definitions, relational
integrity constraints, an SQL API exposed via a “C” CLI and JDBC, and manifest tables that together act as an exchange
and direct-use format for multiple types of geospatial data including vector features, features with raster attributes
and tile matrix pyramids, especially on mobile / hand held devices in disconnected or limited network connectivity
environments.

Table formats, definitions of geometry types and metadata tables, relational integrity constraints, and SQL API are
interdependent specification facets of the SF-SQL [13][11][12] and SQL-MM (Spatial) [14] standards that serve as
normative references for the vector feature portion of this specification.

This specification attempts to support and use relevant raster types, storage table definitions, and metadata from
widely adopted implementations and existing standards such as WMTS [22] and ISO metadata [42], to integrate use of
rasters as attributes of geospatial features, and to define relational integrity constraints and an SQL API thereon to
provide a raster analogy to the SF-SQL and SF-MM data access and data quality assurance capabilities.

Conformance classes for this specification are classified as core (mandatory) and extension (optional). The simple core
of an Empty GeoPackage contains two SQL tables.

Future versions of this specification willmay include requirements for elevation data and routes. Future enhancements to
this specification, a future GeoPackage Web Service specification, and modifications to existing OGC Web Service (OWS)
specifications to use GeoPackages as exchange formats willmay allow OWS to support provisioning of GeoPackages
throughout an enterprise or information community.

None at present.

=== Potential Future Work

* MAY investigate GeoPackage implementation on SQLite version 4 <<B46>>.
* Future versions of this specification MAY include requirements for elevation data and routes.
* Future enhancements to this specification, a future GeoPackage Web Service specification and modifications to existing OGC Web Service (OWS) specifications to use GeoPackages as exchange formats MAY allow OWS to support provisioning of GeoPackages throughout an enterprise.
* Future versions of this specification MAY include additional raster / image formats, including fewer restrictions on the image/tiff format.
* Future versions of this specification MAY include additional SQL API routines for interrogation and conversion of raster / image BLOBs.
* Future versions of this specification and/or one for a GeoPackage Web Service MAY address utilities for importing and exporting vector, raster and tile data in various formats.
* Future versions of this specification and/or one for a GeoPackage Web Service MAY address encryption of GeoPackages and/or individual tables or column values.
* Future versions of this specification MAY add infrastructure to the metadata tables such as a `temporal_columns` table that refers to the time properties of data records.
* MAY specify a streaming synchronization protocol for GeoPackage as part of a future GeoPackage Web Service specification, and/or a future version of the GeoPackage and/or Web Synchronization Service specification(s).
* Future versions of this specification MAY address symbology and styling information.
* Future version of this specification MAY include geographic / geodesic geometry types.
* MAY create a GeoPackage Abstract Object Model to support data encodings other than SQL in a future version of this specification.

=== Terms and Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

[gloassary]
Empty GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage file that contains a `spatial_ref_sys` table, `agpkg_contents` table with row record(s) with `data_type` column values of “features” or “tiles”, and corresponding features tables per clause 2.1. and/or tiles tables per clause 2.2 where the user data tables per clauses 2.1.6. and 2.2.7 exist but contain no rows.
geolocate::
    identify a real-world geographic location
GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage file used with a GeoPackage SQLite Extension
GeoPackage file::
    a platform-independent SQLite database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content constraints.
GeoPackage SQLite Extension::
    executable software linked to a SQLite library with specified configuration requirements to provide SQL API access to and functional manipulation of GeoPackage file contents.
georectified::
    raster whose pixels have been regularly spaced in a geographic (i.e., latitude / longitude) or projected map coordinate system using ground control points so that any pixel can be geolocated given its grid coordinate and the grid origin, cell spacing, and orientation.
orthorectified::
    georectified raster that has also been corrected to remove image perspective (camera angle tilt), camera and lens induced distortions, and terrain induced distortions using camera calibration parameters and DEM elevation data to accurately align with real world coordinates, have constant scale, and support direct measurement of distances, angles, and areas.
Valid GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage file that contains features per clause Error! Reference source not found. and/or tiles per clause Error! Reference source not found. and row(s) in the `gpkg_contents` table with `data_type` column values of “features” and/or “tiles” describing the user data tables.

=== Conventions

Symbols (and abbreviated terms)

Some frequently used abbreviated terms:

[gloassary]
ACID::
    Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable

=== UML Notation

The diagrams that appear in this standard are presented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagrams.
The UML notations used in this standard for RDBMS tables in the GeoPackage container are described in Figure 1 below.

.UML Notation for RDBMS Tables
image::umlnotationforrdbmstables.png[]

In this standard, the following two stereotypes of UML classes are used to represent RDBMS tables:

a. \<<table>> An instantiation of a UML class as an RDMBS table.
b. \<<column>> An instantiation of a UML attribute as an RDBMS table column.

In this standard, the following standard data types are used for RDBMS
columns:

a. NULL – The value is a NULL value.
b. INTEGER – A signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value
c. REAL – The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
d. TEXT – A sequence of characters, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
e. BLOB – The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.
f. NONE – The value is a Date / Time Timestamp

The UML notations used in this standard for the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema for the GeoPackage manifest are described in Figure 2 below.

.UML notation for XML Schema
image::umlnotationforxmlschema.png[]

In this standard, the following stereotypes of UML classes are used to describe XML schemas:

a. \<<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information.
b. \<<Enumeration>> is a fixed enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential values.
c. \<<CodeList>> is an extensible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential values.

In this standard, the standard data types defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/[XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] are used to describe XML Schemas.
